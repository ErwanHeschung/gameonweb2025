# Game zelda like

## Plot

The hero (name ?) is being bullied in reality. He is not much strong, (passions ?). In order
to escape reality, he goes sleeping a lot. In his dream, he is first a little character, as weak as in reality. However,
he can explore the world and meet people and enemies. The more he kills enemies, the stronger he gets.

Each world represents one of his fear/complex etc... When he lands on the final world, he has to battle against a dark
version of himself, which represents all the fears and anxiety he keeps inside him.

When we click on Play, we land into the room of the hero, facing a desk with a diary on top of it. The diary is updated
according to what the hero is encountering/doing in his dreams.
There is also a mirror (so the player can understand the similar appearances between the real hero and the dream hero).

We teleport inside the dream land by going to bed.
